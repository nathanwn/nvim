# My Personal Neovim Configuration

Neovim configuration, (mostly) compatible with neovim 0.9.0.

## Introduction

This repository is a (mostly up-to-date) snapshot of my `~/.config/nvim/` directory.

Over time, my neovim configuration has grown to a point where it makes sense to separate it from my dotfiles repository.

(Also, my dotfiles repository is a giant pile of mess at this point.)


## Structure

I now follow the structure recommended by [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-structuring-your-plugins).
